# Micromouse-20-21
Maze-solving vehicle implemented using an STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller
Detects maze walls using readings from infrared emitter and receiver pairs
Designed breakout board for IR receivers and emitters using EAGLE
Uses encoder readings fed into a PID controller for distance and rotation control
